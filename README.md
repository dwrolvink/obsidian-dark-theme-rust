# Obsidian Dark Theme for VS Code
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwrolvink/obsidian-dark-theme-rust/master/images/preview.png)

# Recognitions
- First off, this is not an official theme, I just slapped something together based on the Obsidian dark theme.
- 99% of this theme is based on: [https://github.com/aziham/obsidian-dark](https://github.com/aziham/obsidian-dark). 
  - I just changed the colors to match the current Obsidian dark theme.

# Other info
As the name of this theme states, I have only looked at Rust code to check if it has the same colors as in Obsidian.
Other languages might look off in the current version (though Python seems OK).

# Installation
1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
